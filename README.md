Project Overview
This project analyzes municipality-level vulnerability to Zika virus transmission in Brazil using spatial data. By integrating climate variables, land use patterns, population density, and sanitation access, it constructs a composite Zika vulnerability index to identify high-risk regions.

Why This Project Is Useful
Vector-borne diseases like Zika are shaped by both environmental conditions and socioeconomic disparities. This project demonstrates how spatial analytics and GIS techniques can be used to combine climate, infrastructure, and land-use data to support public health risk assessment and targeted intervention planning.

Get Started: Clone this repository and install the required dependencies: ArcGis Pro

Data: Brazilian Ministry of Health (DATASUS): sanitation and water access
WorldClim: bioclimatic temperature and precipitation variables
IBGE: municipal boundaries, population, and density
MapBiomas: land use and land cover data
Data spans multiple years and formats (vector, raster, tabular) and is harmonized for spatial analysis at the municipal level.
